I am a postdoctoral researcher in quantum computing and quantum information theory, working at the interface of mathematical physics and the design of reliable quantum algorithms. My research focuses on understanding and exploiting the stability, learnability, verification, and simulation of bosonic and fermionic quantum systems, combining rigorous analysis with the development of quantum learning and simulation algorithms.

After completing my doctorate at the Technical University of Munich as a member of MCQST and the SFB 352, and my master’s studies at ETH Zurich, I have continued my work as a Research Associate in Tübingen as part of the QuantEra TouQan consortium and the SFB 352, and as a Visiting Research Fellow at the University of Cambridge, supported by a personal DFG grant to initiate international collaborations.

My studies at ETH Zurich and my subsequent PhD at TU Munich have shaped my interest in tackling complex problems and in designing mathematically and physically motivated models. If you are interested in collaborating on a suitable topic, I would be happy to discuss.
